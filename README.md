# Mirage's Journey

Mirage's Journey is a 2.5D adventure game involving a dog and his astronaut friend, developped by 4th year students in the Computer Science Engineering cursus at Polytech Paris-Sud. The game is available for download [here](http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/mirage/).


## Play game

The game is a standalone Windows executable but needs an internet connection to be able to login. An user account can be created on the website or directly on the application.

The game consists at the moment of only one level, with several quests and story points. Further game designers could easily create other levels using the engine we developped. 

## Motivation

This game is the result of a year-long project involving a team of 6 people. It has allowed us to tackle various fields of Computer Science, such as web and databases, C# and Unity game development and even user interfaces. The project has definitely 

But the main focus has been on project management. We have gained a lot about efficiency and organisational skills and learned how to successfully complete a project in time. Although we have deviated a lot from the original (and a bit unrealistic) objectives, we have created a game not that far from our expectations. 

A [complete report](https://github.com/minh-n/MiragesJourney/blob/master/Compte-rendu_Final.pdf) is available in French.
