# Mirage's Journey

Mirage's Journey is a 2.5D adventure game involving a dog and his astronaut friend, developped by 4th year students in the Computer Science Engineering cursus at Polytech Paris-Sud. The game is available for download [here](http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/mirage/).

## The game

The game is a standalone Windows executable but needs an internet connection to be able to login. An user account can be created on the website or directly on the application.

The game consists at the moment of only one level, with several quests and story points. Further game designers could easily create other levels using the engine we developped. 

## Motivation and afterthoughts

This game is the result of a year-long project involving a team of 6 people. It has allowed us to tackle various fields of Computer Science, such as web and databases, C# and Unity game development and even user interfaces. The project has definitely taught us a lot of knowledge we would not be able to acquire in traditional classes.

But the main focus has been on project management: we spent a semester planning the project in advance, using professionnal tools such as Gantt charts and risks management tables. We have gained a lot efficiency and organisational skills and learned how to successfully complete a project in time. Although we have deviated a lot from the original (and a bit unrealistic) objectives, we have created a game not that far from our expectations. 

## Documentation 

A [complete report](https://github.com/minh-n/MiragesJourney/blob/master/Compte-rendu_Final.pdf) is available in French, detailing the processes, the difficulties we encoutered and our thoughts on this project.

The Unity project and its scripts can be found in `</Code>`. The comments and the script organisation should help reading it, but the whole code structure only makes sense when used in Unity.

>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.
>To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
